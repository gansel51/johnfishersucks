# John Fisher Sucks

This repo includes code to send an email to John Fisher every five minutes telling him that he sucks. To set the password environement variable on your local machine, run the following code:

`# Set environment variables`
`import os`
`os.environ['email_password'] = 'your_password'`

Alternatively, you can just fill out the password variable with your password if you are not sharing your version of this code publicly.

To John, if you're reading this, I hate you and everything you stand for. Enjoy sitting in the garbage bins at Gap with Kanye.
